TODO
====

1. Update Set to accept a set of types in the constructor.
2. Get rid of TypeSet and update Sequence and Dictionary to use sets of string for the allowed types.
3. Update Type to support the special functions currently in TypeSet.
4. Rename Stringify as Stringify. If a class has a __toString() method, use that. No decode
   method required. This is just for display/debugging. Put key-value pairs and properties on their own
   line. For associative arrays, use square brackets for a more PHP-like syntax. It's not JSON.
   Sets use {} and Dictionaries can use <> with key-value pairs.
